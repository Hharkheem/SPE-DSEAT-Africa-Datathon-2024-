## 🔍 Project Title
**Prediction of Oil, Gas & Water Production in the DSEATS Field Using Machine Learning**

---

## 📘 Overview

This project is a submission for the **SPE Data Science and Engineering Analytics Technical Section (DSEAT) Africa Datathon 2024**. The goal of the competition is to build a robust machine learning model that accurately predicts oil, gas, and water production based on historical well production data.

---

## 📊 Challenge Objective

The main objective of this datathon is to:

- Analyze historical production data from a synthetic oil field.
- Develop a machine learning model that can predict oil, gas, and water production.
- Evaluate the model based on prediction accuracy, innovation, and creativity.

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

The approach follows a complete ML workflow:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing training and validation datasets.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding feature distributions and correlations.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Transforming and creating features to improve model performance.
4. **Model Development**: Training multiple regression models and tuning hyperparameters.
5. **Evaluation**: Using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R² to assess performance.
6. **Prediction**: Generating forecasts for the validation dataset.
